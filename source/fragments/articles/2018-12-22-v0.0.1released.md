## First Public Release Of Trio

I am very excited to announce the first public release of Trio, v0.0.1, on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4awpawz/trio">NPM</a>. This release represents the culmination of months of work, not only on the code base itself but also on the documentation and the example blog.

In the coming weeks I will be publishing a series of "how to" articles and videos that demonstrate using Trio to create static web sites.

Trio is an open source project and it needs you, the community, to provide feedback, suggest new features and report issues and bugs. Please don't hesitate doing so <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/4awpawz/trio/issues">here</a> and you can also reach <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jefftschwartz">me</a> on Twitter.

Pardon the shameless plug but if you enjoy using Trio please consider starring the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/4awpawz/trio">repo</a> and spreading the word :).
