## Trio v4.1.0

It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of Trio v4.1.0.

### Trio now supports callbacks declared on tags that are replaced by include and fragment content.

Prior to v4.1.0, tag-based callbacks declared on tags that are replaced by an include's or a fragment's content are never registered and therefore never called. Trio V4.1.0 corrects this omission and now supports tag-based callbacks on these tags.

Support for these callbacks will allows you to directly target these tags in your tag-based callbacks using the callback's _$tag_ parameter.

Please note that this new behavior doesn't impact how Trio outputs these tags for development and release builds. As always, when building for development, Trio will still comment out these tags in the generated HTML document, and when building for release, Trio will not output these tags in the generated HTML document.
