The process of assembling your site's web pages with Trio is referred to as composition.

Trio's use of project assets, namely <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v4/template">templates</a>, <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v4/fragment">fragments</a>, <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v4/include">includes</a>, <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v4/jsondata">JSON data files</a>, and <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v4/metadata">metadata</a>, all of which are exposed to <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v4/tagbasedcallbacks">tag-based callbacks</a>, allow Trio to excel as a web page composition tool. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the following abstract:

Therefore, as developers of static websites, we need to understand how to effectively use Trio's project assets in our own static site projects. Having this understanding will often reveal that there is more than one way to compose our pages, allowing us to pick the best approach for the task.

The tutorials in this series will teach you how to use Trio's project assets to compose your site's web pages. Each tutorial will introduce new concepts and provide concrete examples that you can read, code, and run for yourselves. Tutorials may also provide you with additional links to content, such as video content, as well as links to Trio's own technical documentation, that will serve to further demonstrate and reinforce what you have read and learned in the tutorials and finally, most of the tutorials in this series will provide you with a list of _takeaways_, which are a summarized list of the core concepts presented in the tutorial.

## Requirements
