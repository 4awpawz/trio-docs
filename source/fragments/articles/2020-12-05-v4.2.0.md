## Trio v4.2.0

It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of Trio v4.2.0.

### Trio now ignores and reports fragments that do not have front matter defined.

Prior to v4.2.0, fragment files that did not have front matter generated errors that were confusing and unnecessary (as far as the user is concerned). These fragments are now reported to the console but otherwise ignored during the build process.
