It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of Trio v6.0.0.

## Highlights

### An Improved Release Workflow That Now Supports JavaScript Bundling

Prior to Trio v6.0.0 cache busting was initiated by running the command `trio release -b`. The problem is that this didn't allow the developer to run their NPM package.json scripts, such as those that might bundle their JavaScript modules, before they cache busted the site. Removing the `-b` option from the `trio release` command and implementing a standalone `trio cachebust` command that can be called after running `trio release` corrects this and allows for an "open" workflow, such as using NPM scripts in your package.json file

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "parcelBuild": "parcel watch source/jsBundle/main.js --no-cache --out-dir public/scripts --public-url /scripts/",
    "trioBuild": "trio b -I",
    "build": "concurrently --kill-others \"npm run trioBuild\" \"npm run parcelBuild\" ",
    "release": "trio r && parcel build source/jsBundle/main.js --no-cache --out-dir release/scripts --public-url /scripts/ && trio cachebust -m && trio s -r"
},
```

for development builds

```shell
# run npm script to bundle JavaScript into public/scripts folder
npm run build
```

and for release builds.

```shell
# run npm script to bundle JavaScript into release/scripts folder
npm run release
```

If your site uses a JavaScript bundler (e.g. Parcel, Browserify, Webpack) to package its runtime JavaScript then _do not host those modules in root/source/scripts_. Instead, _create a new folder in root/source, for example <em>jsBundle</em>, and host them there_. Please see <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v6/projectstructure">Project Structure</a> for details.

### New CSS Source Map Generation Options

Trio now offers sensible configuration options for controlling the generation of CSS map files for both _development_ and _release_ builds.

From within *trio.json* you can now configure source map generation using the following:

```json
"sassSourceMaps": {
    "development": [true | false],
    "release": [true | false]
}
```

Both development and release builds default to `true`.

### Improved Cache Busting, A Breaking Change

Trio v6.0.0 has upgraded its toolchain to use version `v1.0.0` of the browser cache buster <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4awpawz/buster">Buster</a>, which eliminates a bug that would result in URLs being hashed twice. This would occur when a URL points to a file whose file name is used in part in another file's name. This *naming convention* is common for JavaScript map files and CSS map files.

For example, when hashing the file names for the files [*mybundle.js*] and [*mybundle.js*.map] Buster would ultimately hash [*mybundle.js*.map] as [hash-hash-*mybundle.js*.map].

Please note that beginning with Buster v1.0.0, your site's internal URLs are required to be *site releative*. This requirement is a breaking change from previous versions of Buster. What does this mean for your existing Trio projects that are using Trio's cache busting? Existing projects' internal URLs that aren't already site relative will need to be converted. Please see <a href="/docs/v6/linkingconventions/">Linking Conventions</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/4awpawz/buster#project-relative-file-paths-and-site-relative-urls">Buster's documentation</a> for details.
