It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of Trio v6.0.1.

## Highlights

### This Is A Point Release

This release address a bug that was introduced with Trio v6.0.0 and its support for user created folders in the root/source/ folder. These folders, if not ignored, can pollute Trio's metadata and interfere with Trio's build and release workflows. This release corrects that by ignoring these folders which users now identify through the new <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v6/configuration/#ignore">ignore</a> configuration property.
