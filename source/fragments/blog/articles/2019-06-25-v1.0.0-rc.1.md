This marks the first release candidate for Trio v1. The journey from v0.0.6, which served as a solid proof of concept, to now, has been a long and sometimes difficult one, but in the end I can truly say that it has been a labor of love. I hope you all enjoy it. Please see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/4awpawz/trio/tree/master#v100-rc1-ikigai">changelog</a> for details.
