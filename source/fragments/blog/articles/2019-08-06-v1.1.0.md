### Highlights!

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes issue <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/4awpawz/trio/issues/82">#82</a>, where integrity checking and dependency resolution failed to account for templates having indirect references to includes, which caused builds to fail during page generation because of missing include files.
