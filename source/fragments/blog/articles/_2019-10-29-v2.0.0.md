## What Are Collections?

Collections are groups of pages that are dynamically generated by Trio that you would otherwise have to manually create yourself.

As an example, let's imagine that you have a team website which includes a page that lists all the team members. Information about each team member is maintained in a file named root/source/data/team.json. You would now like to create a detail page for every team member and render those pages when someone clicks on one of the team members in the list.

Without collections, you would have to manually create one fragment for each team member's detail page. If there are only a few team members that wouldn't be too difficult. But suppose there are dozens of team members! Having to manually create and maintain all those fragments would quickly become a burden.

That's where collections come to the rescue; they do all the "heavy lifting" for you. You only need to create *one fragment, and one collection filter function that returns a collection dataset* and Trio will create a "clone" of that fragment for every member of the team.
