# File Names And Permalinks

Websites generated by Trio employ a file structure that encourages the use of permalinks to access its pages
and other resources. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>,
a permalink is:

> "a URL that is intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding a hyperlink that is less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Most modern blogging and content-syndication software systems support such links. Sometimes URL shortening is used to create them."
