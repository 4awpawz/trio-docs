<h2>Build Vs. Release</h2>

<p>Running <code><em>build</em></code> targets the root/public folder, and is what you do while you are developing your site. Trio generate a CSS map file and generate pages whose fragments were marked as a WIP.</p>

<p>Running <code><em>release</em></code> targets the root/release folder, and is what you do prior to deploying your site to its server. Trio doesn't generate a CSS map file, doesn't generate pages whose fragments were marked as a WIP, cleans your site's pages of all their <em>data-trio-*</em> tag attributes and provides the option to cache bust the generated site.</p>
