<h1>About</h1>

<p>Trio is an open source static site generator built with Node. Using its command-line interface, you create new static site projects, and incrementally build and run your sites in the browser.</p>

<p>Trio's unique approach to extending your pages with dynamic content using its <em>tag-based callback mechanism</em> makes it stand out from other static site generators, which rely on either templating engines or frameworks.</p>

<p>Trio requires some knowledge in coding HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some Node experience is also needed, though the degree of Node expertise that is required to effectively use Trio is minimal; in particular, <em>you should know how to require and export modules</em>.</p>

<p>This site serves as the official documentation site for the Trio project and its source is hosted on Github at <a class="doc-page__decorated-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/4awpawz/trio-docs">4awpawz/trio-docs</a>.</p>

    <li>It is recommended that you first read the <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v1/gettingstarted">Getting Started page</a> to learn how to install Trio on your computer.
    </li>
    <li>Then read the <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v1/keyconcepts">Key Concepts page</a>, which will provide you with information about Trio's core concepts, such as what project assets are, and how Trio uses them to construct your site's pages.</li>
    </li>
    <li>Familiarize yourself with Trio's terminal <a data-trio-link href="/docs/v1/commandline">command line interface</a>.</li>
