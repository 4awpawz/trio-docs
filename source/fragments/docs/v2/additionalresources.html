<h2>ESLint Support For Your JavaScript</h2>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs">shareable ESLint configuration</a> package has been made available for you to install and use in your Trio projects. It will install ESLint, its dependencies and create an <em>.eslintrc.json</em> file in your project's root folder. This package extends <em>eslint-config-standard</em>, so out of the box it comes with sensible default rules, which of course, you are able to override and extend.</p>
<p>To install this package in your projects, please follow the instructions below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If your project doesn't already have a <em>package.json</em> file, create one by opening a terminal, navigating to your project's root folder, and running the following command: <pre><code class="shell">npm init -y</code></pre></li>
    <li>Now run the following command in your terminal to install the shareable ESLint configuration package: <pre><code class="shell">npm i --save-dev @4awpawz/eslint-config-4awpawzconfig</code></pre></li>
</ul>
