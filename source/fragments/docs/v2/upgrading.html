<h1>Upgrading</h1>

<h2>From v1 To v2</h2>

<p>The schema for the <em>cache</em> has changed for v2.0.0, and <em>is incompatible with prior versions</em>. Therefore, if you are upgrading your projects from v1 to v2, you will have to regenerate your project's cache, which you can do by running the following <em>build command</em> in the terminal:</p><pre><code class="shell">$ trio build | b</code></pre></p>
