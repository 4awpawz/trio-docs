<h1>Additional Resources</h1>
<p>On this page are additional resources that you may find beneficial.</p>

<h2 id="eslint">ESLint Support For Your JavaScript</h2>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs">shareable ESLint configuration</a> package is available for you to install and use in your Trio projects, which will install ESLint and all its dependencies. This package extends <em>eslint-config-standard</em>, so out of the box it comes with sensible default rules which, of course, you are able to override and extend.</p>
<p>To install this package in your projects, please follow the instructions below:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If your project doesn't already have a <em>package.json</em> file, create one by opening a terminal, navigating to your project's root folder, and running the following command: <pre><code class="shell">npm init -y</code></pre></li>
    <li>Now run the following command in your terminal to install the shareable ESLint configuration package: <pre><code class="shell">npm i --save-dev @4awpawz/eslint-config-4awpawzconfig</code></pre></li>
        <li>In your project's root folder create a new file and name it <em>.eslintrc.json</em>. Now copy the following <pre><code class="javascript">{
    "extends": "@4awpawz/eslint-config-4awpawzconfig"
}</code></pre> into this new file and save this file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>An NPM Package For Importing Uncached Modules</h2>
<p>When your <em>tag-based callbacks</em> and <em>filter functions</em> have their own internal module dependencies, you should import those dependencies using <em>import-fresh</em> (or some similar package) to guarantee that you are always importing fresh, uncached copies of them and they reflect your most recent changes.</p>
<p>To install <em>import-fresh</em> in your projects, please follow the instructions below:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If your project doesn't already have a <em>package.json</em> file, create one by opening a terminal, navigating to your project's root folder, and running the following command: <pre><code class="shell">npm init -y</code></pre></li>
    <li>Now run the following command in your terminal to install the import-fresh package: <pre><code class="shell">npm i --save-dev import-fresh</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Use <em>import-fresh</em> in your tag-based callbacks and your filter functions just as you would use Node's built-in global <em>require</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">const importFresh = require("import-fresh");
const someDependency = importFresh("./lib/someModule");</code></pre>
