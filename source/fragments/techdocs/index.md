# Trio Technical Document

[ User stories ](../userstories) are a great way to learn something new. These stories make you an active observer, learning along with the subject of each story as new topics are introduced. It is highly recommended that you read these stories before reading this technical documentation.

##  Welcome to Trio

Trio is a simple to use static website generator built with Node.js. It reflects its author's desire to rely exclusively upon the three pillars of the web - *HTML*, *JavaScript* and *CSS* - along with *YAML front matter* and with the *least amount of configuration necessary*, to create static websites.

As such Trio is somewhat opinionated but if you love working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript then you just might love creating static websites with it. 

This isn't just la di da!

## About This Document

Throughout this document the term `content` is understood to mean `html` or `markdown`.

## Features

* Supports `Sass` (i.e. .scss, .sass, .map ) and vanila `CSS`. See [Project Structure](#project-structure) for more information.

* `Permalinks` are automatically generated for all internal links and are derived from an index.html file's parent folder name or an .md or .html file's name. See [URLS](#urls) for more information.

* Prepends production site's `base url` segment to URLS in `src` and `href` attributes when building your site's release build. For more information see [data-trio-link](#data-trio-link), [configuration](#configuration) and [command line](#command-line).

* Cache busts your files using MD5 hash-based file names when building your site's release build.

* Extensive support for [blogging](#blogging) including tags, categories and numerous catalogs of blog-specific metadata that are exposed to JavaScript callbacks used to customize your blog pages.

* Trio generates an extensive collection of [metadata](#metadata) that it exposes to the JavaScript callbacks you use to customize your web pages and also as a JSON file, `trio.metadata.json`, which it saves in the root of your project folder. Having the ability to actually see this data makes it much easier to reason about when coding the [JavaScript callbacks](#javascript-callbacks) that will use this data to to dynamically add content to and customize your web pages.

* Through the use of *convention over configuration*, Trio requires almost zero [configuration](#configuration), which means you can start using Trio right out of the box.

* Simple and easy to reason about [project structure](#project-structure).

* [Front Matter](#front-matter) will parse as HTML comments and wont break your markup's formatting.

* Trio provides comprehensive [command line](#command-line) support to assist you while developing your website.

    * Create a new project
    * Build project for development.
    * Watch for changes and refresh the browser.
    * Build project for release.
    * Ask for help, but honestly Trio is so simple to use that you probably wont even need to ask for help.

## Installing Trio

Trio is meant to be installed globally. From the command line please run the following:

```shell
npm i -g @4awpawz/trio
```

## Quick Start

## How Trio Creates Web Pages

For every [include](#includes) file Trio finds in the [source/includes folder](#project-structure) it performs the following action:

1. If the include has front matter and its front matter declares one or more [JavaScript callbacks](#javascript-callbacks), Trio will synchronously call each of the callbacks, passing them a single argument called a [context](#context-argument) whose properties can be destructured and used by the callback to further customize the include's content. 

Then, for every [page fragment](#page-fragments) file Trio finds in the [source/fragments folder](#project-structure), it performs the following actions:

1. Trio merges any content that might be contributed by the page fragment with the content contributed by the page fragment's associated [page template](#page-templates). This produces what can be called a *mashup*.

1. If the mashup contains one or more HTML tags that have a `data-trio-include` attribute, Trio will merge the content of each requested [include](#includes) with the mashup.

1. If the page fragment's front matter declares one or more [JavaScript callbacks](#javascript-callbacks), Trio will synchronously call each of the callbacks, passing them a single argument called a [context](#context-argument) whose properties can be destructured and used by the callback to further customize the mashup. 

## Front Matter

Trio projects make extensive use of YAML front matter to customize their web pages. You can define your own custom front matter properties to build out your web pages and Trio [ predefines serveral front matter properties ](#properties-predefined-by-trio) for you to use as well.

__!__ _Both [page fragments](#page-fragments) and [includes](#includes) can contain front matter._

Below is an example of a page fragment with front matter

```html
<!--
template: default.html
appendToTarget: true
title: About
activeHeaderItem: 4
callback: showCurrentPageInHeader.js
-->

<div class="banner">
    <img data-trio-link class="banner__image" src="/media/mist-niagara-falls-river.jpg" alt="image of blog">
</div>

<section class="container">
    <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
</section>`
```

and below is a JavaScript representation of that fragment's front matter.

```js
matter: {
    content: "<div class=\"banner\">\n    <img data-trio-link class=\"banner__image\" src=\"/media/mist-niagara-falls-river.jpg\" alt=\"image of blog\">\n</div>\n\n<section class=\"container\">\n    <h1 class=\"page-title\">About</h1>\n</section>",
    data: {
        template: "source/templates/default.html",
        appendToTarget: true,
        title: "About",
        activeHeaderItem: 4,
        callback: "showCurrentPageInHeader.js"
    },
    isEmpty: false,
    excerpt: ""
}
```

__!__ _Trio uses the resilient and performant [gray-matter library](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) to implement its front matter support. If you aren't already familiar with front matter you are urged to follow the link to this library and read its excellent documentation._

__!__ _Trio uses the open and close HTML comment tags (i.e. &lt;!--, --&gt;) as YAML front matter open and close delimiters, so front matter will not create formatting issues in your .html and .md files._

### Properties Predefined By Trio

Trio predefines several front matter properties that can be used in [ includes ](#includes) and [ page fragments ](#page-fragments). Their usage is described below.

#### `template`

```html
<!--
template: default.html
-->
```

value type: a `string`

context: page fragments only

required: yes

It is used to associate a [page template](#page-templates) file with this [page fragment](#page-fragments).

#### `appendToTarget`

```html
<!--
appendToTarget: true
-->
```

value type: a `boolean`

context: includes and page fragments

required: no

When used in an [include](#includes) and if set to `true` then Trio will append the include's content to the html tag in the associated [page template](#page-templates) that has the [`data-trio-include`](#data-trio-include) attribute. If set to `false` or if the property isn't declared then Trio replaces the html tag in the associated page template that has the `data-trio-include` attribute with the include's content.

When used in a [page fragment](#page-fragments) and if set to `true` then Trio will append the page fragment's content to the html tag in the associated [page template](#page-templates) that has the [`data-trio-fragment`](#data-trio-fragment) attribute. If set to `false` or if the property isn't declared then Trio replaces the html tag in the associated page template that has the `data-trio-fragment` attribute with the page fragment's content.

#### `title`

```html
<!--
title: About
-->
```

value type: a `string`

context: page fragments only

required: yes

It is used to set the value of the generated page's title tag.

__!__ _You can also use the title property for h1 tags in your pages._

#### `callback`

```html
<!--
callback:
  - article.js
  - showCurrentPageInHeader.js
-->
```

value type: a `single string` or an `array of strings`

context: includes and page fragments

required: no

It is used to declare one or more names of JavaScript files whose *modules* will be called synchronously by Trio. For more information see [JavaScript Callbacks](#javascript-callbacks).

#### `tag`

```html
<!--
tag:
  - javascript
  - html
  - css
-->
```

value type: a `single string` or an `array of strings`

context: blog article page fragments only

required: no

It is used to assign one or more tags to this blog article. See [blog] and [tag] for more information.

#### `category`

```html
<!--
category:
  - Web Development
  - Trio
-->
```

value type: a `single string` or an `array of strings`

context: blog article page fragments only

required: no

It is used to assign one or more categories to this blog article. See [blog] and [category] for more information.

#### `forTag`

```html
<!--
forTag: css
-->
```

value type: a `string`

context: blog tag page fragments only

required: no

It is used to identify the blog tag that this page fragment is associted with. See [blog] and [forTag] for more information.

#### `forCategory`

```html
<!--
forCategory:
  - web development
  - trio
-->
```

value type: a `single string` or an `array of strings`

context: blog category page fragments only

required: no

It is used to identify the blog categories that this page fragment is associted with. See [blog] and [forCategory] for more information.

### Excerpts

```html
<!--
.
.
.
-->
This is an excerpt.
<!-- end -->
This is the rest of the content.
```

You can explicitly declare a part of an include's or page fragment's content that directly follows front matter as an excerpt by using the separator `<-- end -->`.

## Page Fragments

Page fragments, often just called fragments, can be either markdown or HTML files and must always contain [YAML front matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter). They optionally may also contain markdown or HTML content.

__!__ _Every page fragment must declare the [page template](#page-templates) it is associated with using the front matter [ `template` ](#template) property._

Below is an example of a fragment with front matter and HTML content:

```html
<!--
template: default.html
appendToTarget: true
title: About
activeHeaderItem: 4
callback: showCurrentPageInHeader.js
-->
<div class="banner">
    <img data-trio-link class="banner__image" src="/media/mist-niagara-falls-river.jpg" alt="image of blog">
</div>

<section class="container">
    <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
</section>
```

Below is an example of a fragment that only contains front matter:

```html
<!--
description: blog index page fragment
template: blog.html
appendToTarget: true
title: Trio Blog
callback:
  - blogindex.js
  - showCurrentPageInHeader.js
page: 1
activeHeaderItem: 3
-->
```

## Includes

Includes are either markdown files or HTML files that you can declare in your [ page fragments ](#page-fragments) and [ page templates ](#page-templates) whose content is copied into mashups. They are used to copy commonly used blocks of content that are shared among numerous pages, such as for site-wide headers and footers for instance.

__!__ _Includes can optionally contain YAML [ front matter ](#front-matter) so therefore they also support JavaScript callbacks._

Below is an example of an include file named *source/includes/header.html* with YAML front matter declaring a JavaScript callback and whose content is used as a site-wide header:

```html
<!--
callback: setBlogFolderName.js
-->
<header class="header-container header-container--fixed">
    <nav class="header__nav">
        <ul class="header__nav-items">
            <li class="header__nav-item">
                <a data-trio-link class="header__nav-item-link" href="/">
                    <i class="fas fa-home header__nav-item-icon"></i>Home</a>
            </li>
            <li class="header__nav-item">
                <a data-trio-link class="header__nav-item-link" href="/docs">
                    <i class="fas fa-file header__nav-item-icon"></i>Docs</a>
            </li>
            <li class="header__nav-item">
                <a id="trio-blog-link" data-trio-link class="header__nav-item-link" href="/blog">
                    <i class="fas fa-columns header__nav-item-icon"></i>Blog</a>
            </li>
            <li class="header__nav-item">
                <a data-trio-link class="header__nav-item-link" href="/about">
                    <i class="fas fa-info header__nav-item-icon"></i>About</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
``` 

### Declaring Includes In Page Fragments And Page Templates

Trio supports both `static` and `dynamic` include file declarations. Static include file declarations hard code the include file's name. Dynamic include file declarations use one level of indirection to resolve the include file's name.

#### Static Include File Declaration

To statically declare an include file in a page fragment or page template, add the data attribute `datata-trio-include` to an HTML tag and assign its value the name of the include file, including its file type of either .md or .html, as its value:

```html
<header data-trio-include="header.html"></header>
```

#### Dynamic Include File Declaration

To dynamically declare an include file in a page fragment or page template, add the data attribute `datata-trio-include` to an HTML tag and assign its value the name of a `front matter property` that Trio expects to resolve to the name of an include file, including its file type of either .md or .html.

Dynamic includes are useful in those situations where a page template is associated with more than one page fragment and each page fragment contributes a diffrent include file.

For example, a page template named `default.html` is associated with two page fragments and somewhere in its content dynamically declares an include file as follows:

```html
<header data-trio-include="header"></header>
```

One of the page fragments associated with the page template has the following properties in its front matter:

```html
<!--
template: default.html
header: simpleheader.html
-->
```

The other page fragment associated with the page template has the following properties in its front matter:

```html
<!--
template: default.html
header: complexheader.html
-->
```

Bothe page fragments are associated with the same page template yet each page fragment is including a different include file.

## Page Templates

Page templates, often just called templates, are HTML files whose markup define the overall structure of web pages.

Below is an example of a page template file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Trio Default Template</title>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Merriweather:900|Sacramento&text=Trio|Source+Sans+Pro" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.1.0/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-lKuwvrZot6UHsBSfcMvOkWwlCMgc0TaWr+30HWe3a4ltaBwTZhyTEggF5tJv8tbt"
        crossorigin="anonymous">
    <link data-trio-link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <header data-trio-include="header.html"></header>
    <main data-trio-fragment></main>
    <footer data-trio-include="footer.html"></footer>
</body>

</html>
```

__!__ _Page fragments declare the page template they are associated with using the [ template ](#template) front matter property._

## Metadata

Trio generates an extensive amount of  metadata while building your project's source folder. During the build process, for example, Trio accumulates data about each page fragment, including any front matter each may have. If the project includes a blog, Trio also generates numerous blog specific metadata. Much of this metadata is organized as lists, making them simple to iterate over in the [JavaScript callbacks](#javascript-callbacks).

Below is a list of the metadata items that Trio generates, including their key names and their descriptions:

### `timestamp`

```js
{
    timestamp: "2018-9-25 19:27:50"
}
```

The project's build date and time.

### `userConfig`

_* trio.json_
```js
{
    userConfig: {
        blogFolderName: "trioblog",
        baseUrl: "/trioiopages"
    }
}
```
    
The content of the prject's `trio.json` [configuration](#configuration) file.

### `dataCatalog`

_* source/data/author.json, source/data/fruits.json, source/data/vegies.json_
```js
{
    dataCatalog: {
        author: {
            name: "Janet Doe",
            birthday: "1978-01-14",
            email: "janetdoe@janetdoe.com",
            country: "United States",
            address: "1 East Drive Lane",
            city: "Manchester",
            state: "Newhamshire",
            zip: "00000"
        },
        fruits: ["apples", "pears", "grapes"],
        vegies: ["spinach", "zucchini", "peas"]
    }
}
```

A hash with one key/value pair for each .json file found in the the project's [source/data folder](#project-structure). The keys are the names of the individual files and the values are the file's content.


### `frags`

```js
{
    frags: [
        {
            path: "source/fragments/index.html",
            matter: {
                content: "<div class=\"banner\">\n    <img data-trio-link class=\"banner__image\" src=\"/media/triad.jpg\" alt=\"image of triad\">\n</div>\n\n<section class=\"container\">\n    <h1 class=\"page-title\">Everything you always wanted in a static site generator... but less.</h1>\n</section>",
                data: {
                    template: "source/templates/default.html",
                    appendToTarget: true,
                    title: "Welcome to Trio!",
                    activeHeaderItem: 1,
                    callback: "showCurrentPageInHeader.js"
                },
                isEmpty: false,
                excerpt: ""
            },
            id: 13,
            destPath: "public/index.html",
            url: "/"
        },
        .
        .
        .
    ]
}
```

#### `path`

The page fragment's file path.

#### `matter`

The page fragment's YAML front matter.

#### `id`

The page fragment's unique id.

#### `destPath`

## JavaScript Callbacks

After Trio merges the content of an include or a page fragment with the content of its associated template, Trio then calls one or more JavaScript callbacks if they are declared in the include's or page fragment's front matter with the `callback` property.

Each callback is passed a single object called a [context](#context-argargujment), which, in addition to the context's other properties, includes all the front matter declared in the include or page fragment file. This, along with the context's other properties, can be used to dynamically manipulate the content of your web pages.

Below is an example of a JavaScript callback used to customize a web page's navigation menu: 

```js
module.exports = ({$, frag}) => {
    $(`li.header__nav-item:nth-child(${frag.activeHeaderItem})`)
        .addClass("header__nav-item--active");
};
```

In the callback example above, you might think that the `$` argument is a `jQuery` object, but it is not.

__!__ _There is absolutely no browser involved here, only streams of markup text. So jQuery, which interacts with the browser, and not with streams of markup text, would be totally useless._

The `$` argument is, in fact, a `cheerio` object that wraps the mashed up page.

__!__ _Instead of peppering your markup with templating language tags, such as those used with Liquid and Handlebars templates for instance, Trio uses [cheerio]( https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), which is a jQuery-like JavaScript API based screen-scraper, along with front matter and synchronous JavaScript callbacks to dynamically manipulate the content of your web page._

### Context Argument

Trio passes a single object, called a `context`, to each callback:

```js
{
    $,
    frag,
    siteMetadata,
    cheerio
};
```

#### `$`

A `cheerio` object that wraps the mashed up page.

#### `frag`

An object that exposes all the `metadata` specific to the include or page fragment for which this callback was called, including all its front matter properties.



#### `site`

An object that exposes all the `metadata` for the entire site.

#### `cheerio`

A cheerio object that can be used to create new cheerio wrappers.

## data-trio Attributes

Trio recognizes numerous *data attributes* in HTML tags that begin with `data-trio-`. The presence of these attributes instruct Trio to take unique actions according to each specific data attribute.

Below is a complete list of these attributes along with their descriptions.

### `data-trio-fragment`

```html
<main data-trio-fragment></main>
```

This attribute is meant to be used in page tempates and instructs Trio to target this HTML tag when merging the page fragment content with this page template.

__!__ _data-trio-fragment can be omitted if the page template is designed to be used by page fragments that do not contribute content._

By default, Trio replaces the HTML tag with the content from the page fragment. To append the content to this HTML tag, declare `appendToTarget: true` in your page fragment front matter. For more information see [appendToTarget](#appendtotarget).

### `data-trio-include`

```html
<header data-trio-include="header.html"></header>
```

This attribute, which can be used in page fragments and page templates, instructs Trio to target this HTML tag when merging the specified include file's content.

By default, Trio replaces the HTML tag with the content from the include file. To append the content to this HTML tag, declare `appendToTarget: true` in your include file front matter. For more information see [appendToTarget](#appendtotarget).

### `data-trio-link`

```html
<link data-trio-link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">

<a data-trio-link href="/">

<a data-trio-link href="/about">

<img data-trio-link src="/media/mist-niagara-falls-river.jpg">
```

This attribute, which can be used in includes, page fragments and page templates, instructs Trio to prepend your production site's *base url* to this tag's `src` or `href` attribute's value when you run a *release build*. For more information see [release build]. You declare your site's base url in your project's `trio.json` configuration file. For more information see [configuration].

For example, if in your trio.json configuration file you declare `baseUrl` as follows:

```json
{
    "baseUrl": "/xyz",
}
```

then when you run a release build, Trio will generate the following:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/xyz/css/style.css">

<a href="/xyz">

<a href="/xyz/about">

<img src="/xyz/media/mist-niagara-falls-river.jpg">
```
