    <h2>Your Financial Support Of This Project Is Greatly Appreciated</h2>
    <p class="donation-request__copy">
        Trio is an open source project and is therefore free of charge to use
        both for noncommercial and commercial use, but when you use Trio to
        create a new website, please consider donating a few bucks. It doesn't
        take very long, the process is secure, and it will allow us to continue
        to support the community and to maintain and enhance Trio going forward.
